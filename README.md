## Overview

A repository provides the project developed for the `Radar Imaging` course. The projects are the following:
### [Multipath in automotive radar imaging](/Multipath%20in%20Automotive%20Radar%20Imaging/)
The objective of this homework is to understand the effect of multipath in automotive radar imaging. One of the main concerns of the automotive industry about the usage of radars on car is the effect of multipath. Multiple reflections of the electromagnetic wave can generate ghost targets in the focused image. These ghost targets may trigger dangerous maneuvers in
advanced autonomous driving systems. In this homework you will learn how a radar system perceives the multipath and what are the risks associated with different antenna layout.

Further details and requirements can be found in [Assignment1.pdf](/Multipath%20in%20Automotive%20Radar%20Imaging/Assignment1.pdf), and the discussions on the code and results are provided in [Report1.pdf](/Multipath%20in%20Automotive%20Radar%20Imaging/Report1.pdf).

### [SAR Interferometry (InSAR)](/SAR%20Interferometry%20(InSAR)/)

This homework aims to simulate a space-borne radar acquisition and perform SAR interferometry (InSAR) on two (or more) images. In particular, you will try to estimate the topography of the scene starting from an interferometric couple. Estimating the sceneâ€™s elevation is not the only task in which InSAR excels. InSAR is useful also for deformation estimation, atmospheric mapping, change detection, and more. In Figure 1 you can see a so-called interferogram: this is how an earthquake is seen through the eyes of a radar satellite.

Further details and requirements can be found in [Assignment2.pdf](/SAR%20Interferometry%20(InSAR)/Assignment2.pdf), and the discussions on the code and results are provided in [Report2.pdf](/SAR%20Interferometry%20(InSAR)/Report2.pdf).
